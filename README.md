# Arcane Academy of React

Welcome, apprentice wizard, to the **Arcane Academy of React** — where you'll learn the mystical arts of component-based magic!

## The Wizarding War

Dark times approach... Every decade, the greatest magical academies across the realm gather for the legendary **Wizarding War** — a grand competition where students prove their mastery of React magic through increasingly complex challenges.

You've been chosen as a new student at the Arcane Academy. Through three phases of rigorous training, you'll build your skills from basic incantations to advanced battle systems. By the end, you'll command a fully functional battle dashboard where wizarding teams clash in real-time combat!

## 📚 Course Structure

This course contains **13 modules** divided into **four progressive phases**:

### Phase 1: JavaScript Basics (Modules 1-4)

**Technology**: React CDN + Plain JavaScript

- Module 2: JSX and Components
- Module 3: State with useState
- Module 4: Forms and Event Handling

### Phase 2: Core React (Modules 5-7)

**Technology**: Vite + JavaScript

Build complete Academy systems using modern tooling. Master side effects, styling, and component composition as you prepare for the coming war.

- Module 5: Side Effects with useEffect
- Module 6: Styling in React (CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind)
- Module 7: The Children Prop

### Phase 3: Routing + Advanced (Modules 8-12)

**Technology**: Vite + TypeScript

The war begins! Learn client-side routing, build the battle system with TypeScript for type safety, and master advanced patterns and optimization techniques.

- Module 8: Built-in React Hooks
- Module 9: Custom Hooks
- Module 10: Context API for Global State
- Module 11: React Router
- Module 12: Performance and Code Splitting

### Phase 4: Modern Server Rendering (Module 13) - **Capstone**

**Technology**: Next.js / Remix / Astro + TypeScript

Victory achieved! Now share the Academy's knowledge with the world. Learn modern server rendering with React Server Components and Islands Architecture.

- Module 13: Modern Server Rendering
  - Part A: React Server Components (Next.js + Remix paths)
  - Part B: Islands Architecture (Astro path - bonus)

## What You'll Build

Each module contains:

1. **Demo** — A straightforward technical example showing the concept in action
2. **Three Quests** — Themed exercises with story context that advance your skills and the narrative

By Module 13, you'll have built:

- A complete student management system
- Spell and potion directories
- Resource management dashboards
- A fully interactive battle arena with:
  - Two teams of wizards fighting in real-time
  - Health and mana tracking
  - Spell animations and damage calculations
  - Victory determination
  - Lazy-loaded sections for optimal performance

By Module 13, you'll deploy production server-rendered applications:

- Academy Knowledge Portal with React Server Components (Next.js/Remix)
- OR Lightning-fast content site with Islands Architecture (Astro)
- Real hosting on Vercel, Netlify, or Fly.io
- SEO-optimized and production-ready

## Prerequisites
