# Quest 3: The Ultimate Battle Arena ⚔️

## THE FINAL QUEST!

Build the complete interactive battle system - the culmination of everything you've learned!

## Requirements (TypeScript)

### Core Battle System

- Health and mana bars for each wizard
- Spell casting interface with buttons
- Damage calculations using all stats
- Victory determination (first team to 0 health loses)
- Battle log showing actions
- Reset button to start over

### Lazy-Loaded Sections
- Main Battle View (always visible)
- Student Roster Drawer (lazy loaded with React.lazy)
- Spell Library (separate lazy component)
- Statistics Dashboard (lazy loaded)
- Use Suspense with loading states

### Optimization
- useMemo for damage calculations
- React.memo for wizard cards
- useCallback for event handlers
- Proper key props
- No unnecessary re-renders
