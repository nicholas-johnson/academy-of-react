# Module 12: Performance and Code Splitting

## Story Context

The Academy's systems are slowing down! Too many students, too many spells, too much rendering. Learn **performance optimization** to keep the magic flowing smoothly.

## Learning Objectives

- Prevent unnecessary re-renders with React.memo
- Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo
- Stabilize function references with useCallback
- Lazy load components with React.lazy
- Code splitting with Suspense
- Measure and optimize performance
- Understand when optimization matters

## React + TypeScript Concepts

- Typed memo components
- Generic useMemo/useCallback
- Lazy component types
- Performance profiling
- Bundle analysis

## Setup

TypeScript + Vite. Run `npm install` then `npm run dev`.

## Quests

1. **Battle Calculator** - useMemo for expensive calculations
2. **Spell List Optimizer** - React.memo and useCallback
3. **Lazy Academy** - Code splitting with lazy/Suspense
