# Module 5: Side Effects with useEffect

## Story Context

The Academy's information systems need to connect to the outside world! Students must master the useEffect hook to fetch data from magical APIs, handle timers, and implement auto-save functionality. This is where React becomes truly powerful — connecting to real data sources.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand side effects in React
- Master useEffect hook
- Handle component lifecycle
- Implement cleanup functions
- Fetch data from APIs
- Work with timers and intervals
- Debounce operations

## React Concepts

- useEffect hook
- Dependency arrays
- Cleanup functions
- Async operations in effects
- Effect timing (mount, update, unmount)

## Setup

Navigate to `demo/`, run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`.

## Quests

1. **Meditation Timer** - Countdown timer with cleanup
2. **War Intelligence** - Fetch data from API
3. **Auto-Save** - Debounced localStorage sync
