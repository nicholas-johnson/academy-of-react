Create expensive spell damage calculation (attacker stats × defender stats × spell power × random factors). Optimize with useMemo. Show performance improvement.

## Requirements (TypeScript)
- Complex damage function
- useMemo to cache result
- Dependencies array correct
- Performance comparison
- TypeScript types

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Calculation is expensive (intentionally)
- [ ] useMemo prevents recalculation
- [ ] Only recalculates when deps change
- [ ] Console logs show optimization
- [ ] Proper TypeScript typing
